### How to add pictures to a read.md file easily :)




First, create a Read.md file in a new repository.

Then, go to 'Issues' and open a new one of that. In the smsall print It'll say that you can upload pictures.







You won't actually need to save the new Issue, just open the tab to make a new one and find a pic in your files that you want to add.
